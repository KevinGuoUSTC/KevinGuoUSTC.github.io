# 👤 Bio
I got my Ph.D. degree at [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiang-Yang Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/) (ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow). My research interests include IoT, Wireless Sensing, and Ubiquitous Computing. I am eager to connect and collaborate with fellow researchers interested in these areas. Feel free to reach out to me via email😆.
